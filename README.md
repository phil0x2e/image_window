# image\_window
This rust library aims to give you a simple window to display images in.
It uses [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb) for the windows and [image](https://github.com/image-rs/image) for reading and resizing of the images.

All the methods from the minifb Window can be used on the ImageWindow struct.
